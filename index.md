# What Is It?
SecOps Steward is a platform to help administrators automate common high-privilege tasks and make their SecOps experience easier when managing resources in Microsoft Azure. It includes:

- The Web Interface, a NET5.0 server-side Blazor application
- An Agent runtime for Azure Functions, which executes plugin code in a clean-room environment

The Web UI links the system to a repository of public, signed plugins which can get you started quickly!

# Source Code
The source code for SOS and its library of public plugins is available [here](https://github.com/secopssteward/secopssteward).

# Documentation
Documentation on how to install and use SOS can be found [here](https://docs.secopssteward.com). If you're new to SecOps Steward, you can follow the deployment guide, which automates nearly 100% of the steps required to deploy the system and get started securing your cloud!
